-check if the user wants to quit OR if the user doesn't enter one of the options.
-loop each round of the game
-add statements at the end and the beginning that welcome and thank the user for playing
-loop the whole game, so that they can keep playing until they choose to quit

#set variable keepPlaying to true
#while keepPlaying is true:

    #print statement welcoming players to the game

    #make a key that assigns a number to each chose for the computer
    #(rock is 1, scissors is 2, paper is 3)
    
    #import the random function
    
    #set computer's score to 0
    #set player's score to 0
    
    #while player's score is less than 2 and cokmputer's score is less than 2:
    
        #computer's choice = random number between 1 and 3 
        #player's choice = input 
        
        #start checking user options
        #userChoice = userChoice.lower()
        #if player inputs 'q' or 'Q':
        #   set keepPlaying to False
